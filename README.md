Interactive AI Avatar Using Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project features an interactive AI avatar that leverages basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to interact with users through speech recognition and text processing. The avatar is built using Python with Pygame for graphical display, pyttsx3 for speech synthesis, and speech_recognition for speech-to-text conversion.


Features

Speech Recognition: Captures user speech using the speech_recognition library.

Speech Synthesis: Converts text responses into speech using pyttsx3.

Interactive Avatar: Displays a graphical avatar with changing mouth states to simulate speech.

Basic NLP: Processes recognized speech to handle predefined queries and provide relevant responses.

Custom Responses: Provides responses based on user queries related to Sevendyne IT consultancy.
